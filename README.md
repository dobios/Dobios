- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a computer nerd from Switzerland.  
- ðŸ‘€ I like designing tools that make it easier to describe complex things correctly and reliably.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email (amelia.dobis@princeton.edu).  
- âœ¨ You can find my favorite stuff pinned on my profile ;), as well as on [personal my website](https://cs.princeton.edu/~ad4048).  
**********************************
**Overview:** I'm currently working on improving the performance and capabilities of hardware model checkers through the use of new language-level abastractions or new proof methodology.

#### For Software  
- Most of my work is usually on a compiler or a compiler-like verification tool.
- I like using MLIR for the compiler-esque things I do.  
- I will sometimes dable in something completely unrelated, so always keep your eyes open for that ;).  
  
#### For Hardware  
- I like reasoning about hardware, but I am an awful hardware engineer ^^".
- Most of my work here will be on the languages people use to implement and **verify** their designs. 
- I'm a frequent contributor to [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt) and sometimes [Chisel](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel).
- I'm currently looking into using egraphs to solve tricky hardware verification problems. 
    
#### For Video-Games  
- **Godot** is great, lightweight, easy to use and FOSS.
