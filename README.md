- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a computer nerd from Switzerland who likes thinking about languages and how we can make them better.  
- ðŸ‘€ I like designing tools that make it easier to describe complex things correctly and reliably. When I get imposter syndrome, I try building some automated testing thingies to convince myself that the stuff I build works. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email (amelia.dobis@princeton.edu) or on mastodon.  
- âœ¨ You can find my favorite stuff pinned on my profile ;), as well as on [personal my website (WIP)](https://dobios.github.io).  
**********************************
#### For Software  
- Most of my work is usually working on a compiler or building some automated testing thingy. I do occasionally still dable in video-game dev, but I feel like that arc has reached its end. 
- I will sometimes dable in something completely unrelated, so always keep your eyes open for that ;).  
  
#### For Hardware  
- I like reasoning about hardware, but I am an awful hardware engineer ^^".
- Most of my work here will be on the languages people use to implement and **verify** their designs. 
- I've been doing a lot of work on the verification parts of [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt) and [Chisel](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel) lately.  
    
#### For Video-Games  
- **Godot** is great, lightweight, easy to use and FOSS.  

**************************************  
## Current Projects I'm Working on  
Here is a list of the different projects that I'm currently actively working on.  

#### Various CIRCT, Chisel, and FIRRTL verification stuff 
  - Field: __Hardware Verification / Hardware Compilers__
  - Language: __C++ / MLIR / LLVM / FIRRTL / Scala / BTOR2 / SMTLib / SystemVerilog__
  - Description: Extending and unifying the verfication features of CIRCT.
