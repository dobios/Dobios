- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dobios
- 👀 I’m interested in contemporary compiler designs as well as formal verification systems, really anything related to automated testing for both hardware and software, and also video-game developement.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about modern hardware compiler infrastructure (more specifically [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt)).
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on any free and open-source video game project :).
- 📫 You can reach me via email (andrew.dobis@alumni.epfl.ch) or on linked-in.
