- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a computer nerd from Switzerland.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via email (amelia.dobis@princeton.edu).  
- âœ¨ You can find my favorite stuff pinned on my profile, as well as on [personal my website](https://cs.princeton.edu/~ad4048).  
**********************************
**Overview:** I'm currently working on a formalized foundation for hardware compilation, as well as utilize stronger type-systems in hardware languages.

#### For Software  
- Most of my work is usually on a compiler or a compiler-like verification tool, for which I typically use MLIR.  
- I will sometimes dable in something completely unrelated, so always keep your eyes open for that ;).  
  
#### For Hardware  
- I like reasoning about hardware, but I am an awful hardware engineer ^^".
- Most of my work here will be on the languages people use to implement and **verify** their designs. 
- Most of my work is related to [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt) and sometimes [Chisel](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel).
    
#### For Video-Games  
- **Godot** is great, lightweight, easy to use, and FOSS.
