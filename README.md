- 👋 Hi, I’m a computer nerd from Switzerland who likes thinking about languages and how we can make them better.  
- 👀 I like designing tools that make it easier to describe complex things correctly and reliably.  
- 📫 You can reach me via email (amelia.dobis@princeton.edu) or on mastodon.  
- ✨ You can find my favorite stuff pinned on my profile ;), as well as on [personal my website](https://cs.princeton.edu/~ad4048).  
**********************************
#### For Software  
- Most of my work is usually on a compiler or a compiler-like verification tool.
- I like using MLIR for the compiler-esque things I do.  
- I will sometimes dable in something completely unrelated, so always keep your eyes open for that ;).  
  
#### For Hardware  
- I like reasoning about hardware, but I am an awful hardware engineer ^^".
- Most of my work here will be on the languages people use to implement and **verify** their designs. 
- I'm a frequent contributor to [CIRCT](https://github.com/llvm/circt) and sometimes [Chisel](https://github.com/chipsalliance/chisel).
- I'm currently looking into using egraphs to solve tricky hardware verification problems. 
    
#### For Video-Games  
- **Godot** is great, lightweight, easy to use and FOSS.
